1. upload linked list ADTs (tested in VC++)
note: To use this lib, you need to download the specific .h , .c file and the general.h. Then change the gengral.h file according to the problem you're dealing with. PAY ATTENTION TO EDGE CONDITIONS. Because it's mainly for self use, the ADT interface has a lot of "assume".
