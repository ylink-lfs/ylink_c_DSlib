# ylink_c_DSlib
This library aims to help myself to complete data structure exercises in C without creating same wheels every time.


Note: To use this lib, you need to download the specific .h , .c files and the general.h. Then change the gengral.h file according to the problem you're dealing with. PAY ATTENTION TO EDGE CONDITIONS. Because it's mainly for self use, the ADT interface has a lot of "assume".
